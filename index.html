  		<h4>Personal Story- (Does a bad physical feature turn you off?) 




On November 8th 2017 I met up with someone close. The person asked me to keep their name private! But their question for me was: "What should I do if I do not like a particular physical feature about this guy that I am talking to?" 
I replied: I see where this can be a issue, because I think that you're most likely thinking and Imagining waking up to see that bad physical feature everyday. But, my take on this issue is that sometimes you can grow to like a bad physical feature about someone. It can be very hard in the beginning but you can see it through if its minor like: nose, ears, eyes etc. Okay Imagine that person glowing up and you lose that chance of being with that person because of a supposedly a "bad physical feature." Sometimes that bad physical feature is that persons biggest confidence booster, and all they need is someone to embrace it. Have you ever seen some very unique models and you are like, how did they get into modeling? Yes its like that, sometimes its what you think is bad that makes you unique and different from everyone else. Trust me when I tell you that. But it all boils down to. Is that person making you happy? That Is the question you should ask yourself and if its a yes, then you know what my answer is!</h4>
